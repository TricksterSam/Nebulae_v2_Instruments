# Nebulae_v2_Instruments
Alternative instruments for the Qu-Bit Nebulae v2 Eurorack module. Each file can also be used in any Pure Data project.

This software was written by Samuel Burt in Pure Data. It will run in Pd-vanilla on any computer, but is specifically designed to run on the Qu-Bit Nebulae v2. 

# Installation
Simply copy the pd files onto the root level of your Nebulae USB flash drive. When you turn on your Nebulae, the files will automatically load. To load a file, push and hold the "speed" button for two seconds. Rotate the speed button and observe the five buttons on the Nebulae. When the main instrument page is selected (with the Nebulae's original granular instrument) all five buttons should dimly light. The currently loaded instrument's slot will glow more brightly. From the main instrument page, rotate the "speed" encoder to the right. From here you can select the instrument you want to load by pressing its corresponding button and then pressing the "speed" button. Give the Nebulae about fifteen seconds to load the program.

# Options as of 2022_01_03
The four instruments appear in this order:

00_supersaws.pd
01_chord_maker.pd
02_rainstick.pd
03_pansshadow.pd

# Notes for the future
These instruments are not necessarily in their finished form. They are playable right now! Future iterations might change some of their functionality to provide improvements and more levels of control.
